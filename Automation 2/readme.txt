How to use the Automation 2 Python Program:

Make sure you have python and fillpdf installed using pip!

First Step:
>> Gather a PDF file which had editable Text columns else the Code will not work. If your pdf doesnt conatins one you can use Online websites like ilovepdf or acrobat to place text boxes/ radio buttons.

Every Text boxes has its own code for ex: text_1usfw  is a text box code
Therefore we need to map the text boxes Code with number (1,2,3,4 ....)

Second Step:
>> Open the mapping code and rename your pdf name to whats written there! (Dont edit the code for your own good!) And at the terminal all the text boxes withh be written. You need to copy them all and use Chat gpt to extarct the numbers like in field_names.txt!.

Third Step:
Create and excel file or edit the excel file instead with the numbers provided in mapping pdf. Now using th mapping pdf first row should be (1,2,3,4....) dont bother to edit that and the write the details using the mapping pdf from the second row.

Fourth step:
After editing all the excel file run the python file. It will create all the pdf file in near seconds!

Enjoy!
